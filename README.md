# Simon-Game
A classic Simon game implementation that is now mobile-responsive! This project was originally developed by Angela Yu, and I've made enhancements to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
## Features

- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Enjoy the Simon game on the go! The layout and interactions have been optimized for various screen sizes, making it accessible on mobile phones and tablets.
